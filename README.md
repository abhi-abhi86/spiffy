✨ Features

🔐 End-to-End Encryption: All messages are encrypted using AES-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) for confidentiality and integrity.
🛡️ Transport Security: Uses TLS/SSL sockets to prevent eavesdropping on the handshake.
🔄 Replay Protection: Implements nonce tracking to prevent replay attacks.
📟 Matrix UI: A slick, hacker-style terminal interface with animations and color-coded logs.
🚨 Panic Mode: Instantly clears the screen and displays a fake "System Update" progress bar to hide your chat.
💬 Private Messaging: Support for secure direct messages (whispers) between users.

🔒 Security Architecture

Spiffy implements a dual-layer security model:

Transport Layer: Standard TLS 1.2+ sockets using server.crt and server.key.

Application Layer:

Algorithm: AES-256-GCM.
Key Exchange: Pre-shared Secure Channel Key (generated at server runtime).
Authentication: Challenge-Response mechanism to verify the key before allowing connection.
Replay Defense: Tracks used nonces to reject duplicated packets.
```

```
🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
OpenSSL (for generating certificates)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhi-abhi86/spiffy.git
cd spiffy
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: Requires cryptography library.

3. Generate SSL Certificates
Spiffy requires a certificate pair for TLS. Run this command to generate a self-signed cert for testing:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -nodes -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Org/CN=localhost"
```
```

```

```
🎈 Usage

Run the main script to start:
```bash
python spiffy.py
```

You will be presented with a menu to select your mode:

1. Server Mode ([1])
Initializes the secure server node.
Important: It will display a SECURE CHANNEL KEY. You must copy this key and share it securely with clients who want to connect.

2. Client Mode ([2])
Connects to an existing uplink.
Target IP: IP address of the server (default: localhost).
Access Key: Paste the key generated by the server.
Callsign: Your display name.
```

Command: /dm <user> <msg>
Description: Send a private, encrypted whisper to a specific user.

Command: /clear
Description: Clear the terminal screen.

Command: /panic
Description: Stealth Mode: Clears screen and shows a fake system update.

Command: /quit
Description: Securely close the connection and wipe session memory.

Command: /help

⚠️ Disclaimer

For Educational Use Only.
While Spiffy uses strong cryptographic primitives (AES-GCM, TLS), this implementation is designed for learning and demonstration purposes. It uses self-signed certificates and ephemeral keys. Do not use for mission-critical classified communications without a professional security audit.
