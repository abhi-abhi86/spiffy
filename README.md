✅ Keep detailed logs of your activities  
✅ Stop immediately if you exceed your authorization  
✅ Use the tool in isolated lab environments for learning  

### Don't:
❌ Assume you have permission without explicit written consent  
❌ Test "just to see" if something is vulnerable  
❌ Access data you're not authorized to view  
❌ Use the tool on production systems without approval
