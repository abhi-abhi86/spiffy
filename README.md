Spiffy Secure Chat

Spiffy is a terminal-based encrypted chat application that combines the aesthetic of the Matrix with real cryptographic security. It features End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) using AES-GCM, TLS transport security, and a stealth "Panic Mode" for hiding activity instantly.

✨ Features

🔐 End-to-End Encryption: All messages are encrypted using AES-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) for confidentiality and integrity.

🛡️ Transport Security: Uses TLS/SSL sockets to prevent eavesdropping on the handshake.

🔄 Replay Protection: Implements nonce tracking to prevent replay attacks.

📟 Matrix UI: A slick, hacker-style terminal interface with animations and color-coded logs.

🚨 Panic Mode: Instantly clears the screen and displays a fake "System Update" progress bar to hide your chat.

💬 Private Messaging: Support for secure direct messages (whispers) between users.

🔒 Security Architecture

Spiffy implements a dual-layer security model:

Transport Layer: Standard TLS 1.2+ sockets using server.crt and server.key.

Application Layer:

Algorithm: AES-256-GCM.

Key Exchange: Pre-shared Secure Channel Key (generated at server runtime).

Authentication: Challenge-Response mechanism to verify the key before allowing connection.

Replay Defense: Tracks used nonces to reject duplicated packets.

🚀 Installation

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+

OpenSSL (for generating certificates)

Setup

Clone the repository

git clone [https://github.com/abhi-abhi86/spiffy.git](https://github.com/abhi-abhi86/spiffy.git)
cd spiffy


Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Note: Requires cryptography library.

Generate SSL Certificates
Spiffy requires a certificate pair for TLS. Run this command to generate a self-signed cert for testing:

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -nodes -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Org/CN=localhost"


🎈 Usage

Run the main script to start:

python spiffy.py


You will be presented with a menu to select your mode:

1. Server Mode ([1])

Initializes the secure server node.

Important: It will display a SECURE CHANNEL KEY. You must copy this key and share it securely with clients who want to connect.

2. Client Mode ([2])

Connects to an existing uplink.

Target IP: IP address of the server (default: localhost).

Access Key: Paste the key generated by the server.

Callsign: Your display name.

⌨️ Commands

Once inside the chat, you can use the following commands:

Command

Description

/dm <user> <msg>

Send a private, encrypted whisper to a specific user.

/clear

Clear the terminal screen.

/panic

Stealth Mode: Clears screen and shows a fake system update.

/quit

Securely close the connection and wipe session memory.

/help

Show the list of available commands.

⚠️ Disclaimer

For Educational Use Only.
While Spiffy uses strong cryptographic primitives (AES-GCM, TLS), this implementation is designed for learning and demonstration purposes. It uses self-signed certificates and ephemeral keys. Do not use for mission-critical classified communications without a professional security audit.
